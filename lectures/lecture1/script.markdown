# Objects and Classes
Use class followed by the class’s name to create a class. A property declaration in a class is written the same way as a constant or variable declaration, except that it is in the context of a class. Likewise, method and function declarations are written the same way.

```
class Shape {
    var numberOfSides = 0
    
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
    }
}
```

Create an instance of a class by putting parentheses after the class name. Use dot syntax to access the properties and methods of the instance.

```
var shape = Shape()
shape.numberOfSides = 7
var shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription()
```

This version of the Shape class is missing something important: an initializer to set up the class when an instance is created. Use init to create one.

```
class NamedShape {
    var numberOfSides: Int = 0
    var name: String


    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }


    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
    }
}
```

Notice how self is used to distinguish the name property from the name argument to the initializer. The arguments to the initializer are passed like a function call when you create an instance of the class. Every property needs a value assigned—either in its declaration (as with numberOfSides) or in the initializer (as with name). Use deinit to create a deinitializer if you need to perform some cleanup before the object is deallocated. Subclasses include their superclass name after their class name, separated by a colon. There is no requirement for classes to subclass any standard root class, so you can include or omit a superclass as needed. Methods on a subclass that override the superclass’s implementation are marked with override—overriding a method by accident, without override, is detected by the compiler as an error. The compiler also detects methods with override that don’t actually override any method in the superclass.

```
class Square: NamedShape {
    var sideLength: Double

    init(sideLength: Double, name: String) {
        self.sideLength = sideLength
        super.init(name: name)
        numberOfSides = 4
    }

    func area() -> Double {
        return sideLength * sideLength
    }

    override func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A square with sides of length \(sideLength)."
    }
}

let test = Square(sideLength: 5.2, name: "my test square")
// test.area()
// test.simpleDescription()
```

In addition to simple properties that are stored, properties can have a getter and a setter.

```
class EquilateralTriangle: NamedShape {
    var sideLength: Double = 0.0

    init(sideLength: Double, name: String) {
        self.sideLength = sideLength
        super.init(name: name)
        numberOfSides = 3
    }

    var perimeter: Double {
        get {
            return 3.0 * sideLength
        }
        set {
            sideLength = newValue / 3.0
        }
    }

    override func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "An equilateral triangle with sides of length \(sideLength)."
    }
}
var triangle = EquilateralTriangle(sideLength: 3.1, name: "a triangle")
// print(triangle.perimeter)
triangle.perimeter = 9.9
// print(triangle.sideLength)
```

In the setter for perimeter, the new value has the implicit name newValue. You can provide an explicit name in parentheses after set. Notice that the initializer for the EquilateralTriangle class has three different steps: 1. Setting the value of properties that the subclass declares. 2. Calling the superclass’s initializer. Changing the value of properties defined by the superclass. Any additional setup work that uses methods, getters, or setters can also be done at this point. If you don’t need to compute the property but still need to provide code that is run before and after setting a new value, use willSet and didSet. The code you provide is run any time the value changes outside of an initializer. For example, the class below ensures that the side length of its triangle is always the same as the side length of its square.
```
class TriangleAndSquare {
    var triangle: EquilateralTriangle {
        willSet {
            square.sideLength = newValue.sideLength
        }
    }
    var square: Square {
        willSet {
            triangle.sideLength = newValue.sideLength
        }
    }
    
    init(size: Double, name: String) {
        square = Square(sideLength: size, name: name)
        triangle = EquilateralTriangle(sideLength: size, name: name)
    }
}
var triangleAndSquare = TriangleAndSquare(size: 10, name: "another test shape")
//print(triangleAndSquare.square.sideLength)
//print(triangleAndSquare.triangle.sideLength)
triangleAndSquare.square = Square(sideLength: 50, name: "larger square")
//print(triangleAndSquare.triangle.sideLength)
```

When working with optional values, you can write ? before operations like methods, properties, and subscripting. If the value before the ? is nil, everything after the ? is ignored and the value of the whole expression is nil. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped, and everything after the ? acts on the unwrapped value. In both cases, the value of the whole expression is an optional value.

```
let optionalSquare: Square? = Square(sideLength: 2.5, name: "optional square")
let sideLength = optionalSquare?.sideLength
```

# Enumerations and Structures
Use enum to create an enumeration. Like classes and all other named types, enumerations can have methods associated with them.
```
enum Rank: Int {
    case ace = 1
    case two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
    case jack, queen, king

    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        switch self {
            case .ace:
                return "ace"
            case .jack:
                return "jack"
            case .queen:
                return "queen"
            case .king:
                return "king"
            default:
                return String(self.rawValue)
        }
    }
}
let ace = Rank.ace
let aceRawValue = ace.rawValue
```

By default, Swift assigns the raw values starting at zero and incrementing by one each time, but you can change this behavior by explicitly specifying values. In the example above, Ace is explicitly given a raw value of 1, and the rest of the raw values are assigned in order. You can also use strings or floating-point numbers as the raw type of an enumeration. Use the rawValue property to access the raw value of an enumeration case. Use the init?(rawValue:) initializer to make an instance of an enumeration from a raw value. It returns either the enumeration case matching the raw value or nil if there is no matching Rank.
```
if let convertedRank = Rank(rawValue: 3) {
    let threeDescription = convertedRank.simpleDescription()
}
```

The case values of an enumeration are actual values, not just another way of writing their raw values. In fact, in cases where there isn’t a meaningful raw value, you don’t have to provide one.
```
enum Suit {
    case spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs

    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        switch self {
            case .spades:
                return "spades"
            case .hearts:
                return "hearts"
            case .diamonds:
                return "diamonds"
            case .clubs:
                return "clubs"
        }
    }
}
let hearts = Suit.hearts
let heartsDescription = hearts.simpleDescription()
```
Notice the two ways that the hearts case of the enumeration is referred to above: When assigning a value to the hearts constant, the enumeration case Suit.hearts is referred to by its full name because the constant doesn’t have an explicit type specified. Inside the switch, the enumeration case is referred to by the abbreviated form .hearts because the value of self is already known to be a suit. You can use the abbreviated form anytime the value’s type is already known. If an enumeration has raw values, those values are determined as part of the declaration, which means every instance of a particular enumeration case always has the same raw value. Another choice for enumeration cases is to have values associated with the case—these values are determined when you make the instance, and they can be different for each instance of an enumeration case. You can think of the associated values as behaving like stored properties of the enumeration case instance. For example, consider the case of requesting the sunrise and sunset times from a server. The server either responds with the requested information, or it responds with a description of what went wrong.
```
enum ServerResponse {
    case result(String, String)
    case failure(String)
}

let success = ServerResponse.result("6:00 am", "8:09 pm")
let failure = ServerResponse.failure("Out of cheese.")

switch success {
    case let .result(sunrise, sunset):
    print("Sunrise is at \(sunrise) and sunset is at \(sunset).")
case let .failure(message):
    print("Failure...  \(message)")
}
```

Notice how the sunrise and sunset times are extracted from the ServerResponse value as part of matching the value against the switch cases. Use struct to create a structure. Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they are passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.

```
struct Card {
        var rank: Rank
        var suit: Suit
        func simpleDescription() -> String {
            return "The \(rank.simpleDescription()) of \(suit.simpleDescription())"
    }
}
let threeOfSpades = Card(rank: .three, suit: .spades)
let threeOfSpadesDescription = threeOfSpades.simpleDescription()
```
